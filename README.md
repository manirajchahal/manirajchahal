## Projects

### [Windows Server AD Home Lab](#)
- **Description:** Built a Windows Server 2022 AD Home Lab featuring a domain controller with static IP/DNS, structured OUs with departmental groups and users, secure file services with NTFS permissions, and automated network drive mapping via Group Policy, plus FSRM for quotas and file screening.
- **Technologies:** Windows Server 2022, Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), Group Policy Management Console (GPMC), File Server Resource Manager (FSRM), NTFS Permissions, Cisco Packet Tracer, Windows 10, Static IP/DNS configuration
- **Highlights:** The project deployed a domain controller with a robust OU structure and secure file sharing using NTFS permissions, automated drive mapping via Group Policy, and FSRM for quotas, successfully overcoming static IP/DNS challenges as illustrated by a comprehensive network diagram.

### [Cybersecurity Homelab](#)
- **Description:** I designed and built a comprehensive cybersecurity homelab to simulate real-world network security scenarios in a closed, controlled environment. This project allowed me to gain hands-on experience in configuring and integrating multiple security technologies. 
- **Technologies:** OPNsense Firewall: Installed on an Intel-based PC, configured as the central network defense system with custom firewall rules, NAT, and log forwarding. SIEM Implementation (Wazuh on Raspberry Pi 5): Deployed Wazuh on a Raspberry Pi 5 (16GB RAM) to collect, analyze, and visualize security logs for real-time threat detection and response. Network Segmentation: Utilized a Netgear 8-port Gigabit switch with VLAN configurations to segregate traffic and isolate critical network segments.
- **Highlights:** Developing expertise in firewall configuration, SIEM integration, and network segmentation; gaining practical insights into threat detection, log analysis, and incident response; and enhancing troubleshooting, hardware compatibility, and network security architecture skills advanced my cybersecurity proficiency and enabled me to build a robust lab environment for safely experimenting with offensive and defensive techniques, ultimately preparing me to tackle complex real-world challenges.
